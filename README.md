# World_Weather_Analysis
Start with a weather data dataset. Create a Jupyter Notebook leveraging input statements to filter the data for user's weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, provide four cities to choose from and create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
